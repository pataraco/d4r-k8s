| ansible | side project I was working on to create an Ansible image | Docker | WIP | *self* |
| counting-website | simple website to count visits using node.js and redis. first intro to docker compose | Docker | done | Udemy |
| fibo-k8s | overly complex website to calculate fibonacci numbers deployed using `kubernetes`. evolved from the [fibo-web](fibo-web) project. see the [fibo-k8s's README](fibo-k8s/README.md) | Kubernetes | WIP | Udemy |
| fibo-web | overly complex website to calculate fibonacci numbers. began with just docker compose to get multiple containers to work together and use as a development environment, to using `AWS`, `Terraform` and `Jenkins` to stand up a 'prod' environment. see the [fibo-web's README](fibo-web/README.md) | Docker | done | Udemy |
| flask-app | simple flask app to display random (cat) pictures. used to expand Dockerfile knowledge. | Docker | done | Udemy |
| react-app | simple website to practice docker and set up automatic Jenkin deployments and updates to the website. see the [react-app's README](react-app/README.md) | Docker | done | Udemy |
| redis | just creates a basic `Redis` docker image | Docker | done | *self*? |
| simple-k8s | couple of simple manifests to quickly test k8s deployments | Kubernetes | done | Udemy |
| simple-nodejs-website | simple website deploy testing more dockerfile functionality | Docker | done | Udemy |
| test-docker-desktop | some more simple manifests testing k8s on MAC's docker desktop | Kubernetes | done | *self* |
